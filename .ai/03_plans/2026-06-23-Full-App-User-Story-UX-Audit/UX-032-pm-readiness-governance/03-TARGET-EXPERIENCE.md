|---|---|
| Heading | Derived from fix: Add readiness checklist, approval status by actor, margin/risk alerts, and final |
| Body | PM readiness, actor approvals, owner margin alerts, and final-package lifecycle audit are under-modeled. resolved by Add readiness checklist, approval status by actor, margin/risk alerts, and final-package lifecycle timeline. |
| CTA | Action verb (Save / Retry / Request / Cancel) |

### Recovery Copy

| State | Copy |
|---|---|
| Loading | "Loading..." with Skeleton |
| Empty | "No items yet." |
| Error | "Something went wrong. [Retry] [Contact support]" |
| Permission | "You don't have access to this. [Request access]" |

## State Matrix (target)

| State | Trigger | a11y semantics |
|---|---|---|
| Idle | Mount, no operation | `aria-busy="false"` |
| Loading | Async in flight | `aria-busy="true"`, `aria-live="polite"` |

## Accessibility Requirements

| Requirement | How |
|---|---|
| Keyboard parity | Enter / Space / Arrow keys for every mouse action |
| Screen reader | `role`, `aria-live`, `aria-label` per state matrix |
| Focus management | Move focus on open; return focus on close |
| Color contrast | WCAG 2.2 AA |
| Reduced motion | Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` |
