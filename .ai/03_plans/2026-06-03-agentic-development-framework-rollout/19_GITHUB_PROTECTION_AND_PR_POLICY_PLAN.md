# GitHub Protection and PR Policy Plan

## Current local evidence
CI exists but no live GitHub ruleset/protection mutation was performed in this task.

## Future recommendations
- Rulesets over legacy branch protections where practical; start in evaluate/advisory mode.
- Required checks: validate, build, e2e/perf for release-relevant branches, docs-compliance after dry-runs.
- PR reviews: CODEOWNERS for `.github`, migrations, security/provider docs, `.ai/00_system`, payloads.
- Actions security: least privilege, trusted/pinned actions policy, OIDC, environments, secret scanning/dependency graph/Dependabot/code scanning where available.
- Emergency: preserve Philip admin recovery path.

## Rollback
Document ruleset names/settings before enforcement; switch to evaluate/disabled if urgent recovery blocked.

## 2026-06-03 Phase 1A/1B hard-gate refinement

**Refinement timestamp:** `2026-06-03T15:04:34Z`.

This document is part of a **plan-refinement-only** pass. It does not implement source code, app behavior, dependencies, migrations, package files, runtime/generated files, provider changes, GitHub settings, branch protection, Notion mutations, or secrets. Only `.ai` planning/state/log/bug documents are in scope for this task.

### Phase 1A — repo-local framework implementation

Future Phase 1A is repo-local only. It may update `.ai/00_system`, standardize `.ai/12_agents` payloads, finalize `.ai/08_prompts` templates, finalize `.ai/11_skills` playbooks, and add/adjust thin harness adapters for `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/README.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.commandcode`, `.codex`, `.claude`, `.cursor`, `.gemini`, and other discovered surfaces where authorized. It must resolve or fail-close Hermes, Cursor, Gemini, Ollama, `.agents`, and CommandCode drift policy. It must repair or bug stale root agent-doc facts. It must record graph/tool evidence and use code-review-graph fallback if GitNexus remains broken.

Phase 1A can end as `READY_FOR_PHASE_1A_IMPLEMENTATION` or `PHASE_1A_COMPLETE`, but **not** `PHASE_1_COMPLETE`.

### Phase 1B — Notion mirror hard completion gate

Future Phase 1B starts only after Phase 1A is committed and pushed. It must update the ArchEstimator Notion mirror for the framework, agent roster, prompt library, run logs, dry-run/eval status, GitHub guardrails, provider-proof gates, release readiness, and current proof boundary. It must verify stack facts from live `package.json` at implementation time, include source `.ai` paths, commit hash, mirror date, proof boundary, anti-drift notice, and no secrets.

If Notion mutation is unavailable, unauthorized, or fails, the future implementation agent must create a dated `.ai/15_Bugs` blocker and report `PHASE_1A_COMPLETE_PHASE_1B_BLOCKED`, not `PHASE_1_COMPLETE`. Notion is a mirror only; `.ai`, source, tests, package scripts, commits, and provider evidence remain authoritative.

### Readiness boundary

Current working assessment: Phase 1 repo implementation readiness is approximately 94-96% before this refinement and may honestly reach 98% plan readiness with fail-closed Phase 1A/1B decisions. Global framework enforcement is **not ready**. Enforcement implemented is **0%**. Closed beta remains **NO-GO** until separate external/manual provider proof gates pass. 100% readiness must not be claimed while known gaps remain.

### Live evidence from this refinement

- `git status --short --branch` initially reported `## main...origin/main`; branch `main`; worktree clean at `34b0c3f`.
- `git fetch --prune origin` completed with non-blocking git gc warning about `.git/gc.log` and many unreachable loose objects; no destructive cleanup was run.
- code-review-graph MCP worked: 477 files, 4,361 nodes, 65,147 edges, last updated 2026-06-03T22:34:39; communities above size 20: `workshop-estimate`, `estimates-estimate`, `workshop-project`.
- GitNexus CLI attempts failed with `Cannot destructure property 'package' of 'node.target' as it is null`; future implementation must not claim GitNexus readiness until repaired.
- `package.json` evidence: Next.js 16.2.6, React/React DOM 19.2.6, TypeScript ^6.0.3, Tailwind CSS ^4.3.0, Supabase JS 2.106.2, Supabase SSR 0.10.3, TanStack Query 5.100.14, Zustand 5.0.14, Vitest ^4.1.7, Playwright ^1.60.0.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `bun run validate`, `bun run build`, `bun run test:e2e`, and `bun run test:e2e:perf`.
- Route/test inventory found 48 app page/API route files, 330 TypeScript/TSX files under `src`, and 194 files under `tests`/`e2e`.
- Notion was inspected read-only. `05 Engineering and Architecture` has stale React/DOM 19.2.4 and Supabase JS 2.105.4 against live `package.json`; `07 QA, Evidence, and Drift` has stale graph stats. No Notion mutation occurred.
